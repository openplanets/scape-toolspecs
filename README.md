scape-toolspecs
===============

A home, and version control, for the SCAPE project's tool specifications for the tool-wrapper.

The SCAPE toolspec is a general description of a tool for inclusion on the
SCAPE platform. The toolspec is an XML document defined by the 
[SCAPE toolspec schema](https://github.com/openplanets/scape/blob/master/scape-core/src/main/resources/eu/scape_project/core/model/toolspec/toolspec.xsd). 

The SCAPE toolspec is used by 
[The SCAPE tool wrapper](https://github.com/openplanets/scape-toolwrapper) 
for creating Debian packages for the SCAPE platform.
